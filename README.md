## Rate Limit Tester Shell Script

The Rate Limit Tester Shell Script is a simple tool that allows you to test the rate limiting capabilities of an HTTP server. It sends a specified number of HTTP requests to a given URL with a customizable sleep time between requests and provides feedback on the success or failure of each request.

### Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **curl:** You need the `curl` command-line tool to send HTTP requests. Most Linux distributions come with `curl` pre-installed, but you can also download it from the [official website](https://curl.se/download.html).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `test-rate-limit.sh` script.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./test-rate-limit.sh
